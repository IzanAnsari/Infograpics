Data Visualization Dashboard
The objective of this assignment is to create a data visualization dashboard as per as instructions

Introduction:
This document provides an overview and documentation for the development of a Data
Visualization Dashboard using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to
visualize insights derived from provided JSON data. The dashboard aims to offer interactive
visualization of various parameters such as Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance, Year, Country,
Topics, Region, and City.

Technologies Used:
➢ MongoDB: Database management system to store and manage the provided JSON data.
➢ Express.js: Backend framework for building the RESTful API to interact with the
MongoDB database.
➢ React.js: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
➢ Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for running the server-side application.
➢ Chart.js: Data-Driven Documents library for creating interactive and dynamic
visualizations.
➢ Other visualization libraries such as chart.js, fusioncharts, plotly.js, etc., can be used based
on project requirements.
To start the project:
Backend Setup:
➢ Navigate to the backend directory of your project.
➢ Run npm install to install all the required dependencies.
➢ Start the backend server by running npm run dev or node server.js.
Frontend Setup:
➢ Navigate to the frontend directory of your project.
➢ Run npm install to install all the required dependencies.
➢ Start the frontend development server by running npm start.



Backend-Server

Project Structure:
• server.js: Main file for server initialization and middleware setup.
• routes/api.js: Contains API endpoints for fetching data from MongoDB.
• models/dataModel.js: Defines the data schema for MongoDB.
• db/connect.js: Establishes connection with MongoDB database.
API Response Formatting:
➢ Ensure that API responses are well-formatted and include relevant information. Use JSON
formatting to make responses easy to read and work with.
Error Handling:
➢ Implement robust error handling mechanisms. Return appropriate HTTP status codes along with
clear error messages in case of failures.
Logging and Monitoring:
➢ Set up logging to track server activities and errors. Consider using tools like Winston or Morgan
for logging purposes.
➢ Implement monitoring solutions to track server performance metrics and uptime.
Database Setup:
➢ Import the provided JSON data into a MongoDB database.
➢ Use MongoDB Compass or shell commands to import the data.
➢ Ensure proper indexing for efficient querying.
Performance Testing:
➢ Measure API response times and throughput under different load conditions using Postman's load
testing features.
➢ Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize backend services accordingly.
➢ Thunder (Thunder Client in VS Code):


Frontend-Client

Project Structure:
• src/App.js: Main component handling routing and overall structure.
• src/components/: Directory for React components.
• src/services/api.js: Service file for making API requests to the backend.
• src/pages/: Directory for different dashboard pages such as Home, Visualization, etc.
Frontend Development:
➢ Develop React components for building the user interface.
➢ Utilize React Router for navigation between different pages.
➢ Integrate Chart.js or other visualization libraries for creating interactive charts and graphs.
➢ Implement filter components to allow users to filter data based on various parameters.
Dashboard Features:
➢ Visualization of data parameters such as Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance, Year, Country,
Topics, Region, and City.
➢ Interactive charts and graphs for better understanding of data insights.
➢ Filter options including end year filter, topics filter, sector filter, region filter, PEST filter,
source filter, country filter, city filter, and any other relevant filters.
➢ Dynamic updating of visualizations based on selected filters for real-time analysis.
Context Api:
➢ The Context API in React enables centralized state management, allowing multiple
components to access shared data without prop drilling.
➢ The ApiProvider component encapsulates API-related state, including search parameters,
fetched data, and computed totals.
➢ The useApi hook grants components access to the shared state provided by the ApiProvider,
facilitating seamless interaction with the data.
➢ The ApiProvider responds to user actions, such as selecting search parameters, by fetching
relevant data and updating the state dynamically.
➢ This dynamic behavior enables the dashboard to display real-time insights based on user
input, enhancing usability and providing a more interactive experience.
Styling and Theming:
➢ Enhance the visual appeal of your application with attractive styling and theming.
➢ Use modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox or Grid for layout design.
➢ Consider using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for ready-made styling components.
Responsive Design:
➢ Ensure that your application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.
➢ Test your application on various devices and screen resolutions to ensure a consistent user
experience.
Accessibility:
➢ Make your application accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility best practices.
➢ Use semantic HTML markup and provide alternative text for images.


Conclusion:

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Data Visualization
Dashboard project, including technologies used, project structure, database setup, backend
and frontend development, dashboard features, and overall implementation guidelines. The
completed dashboard offers an interactive platform for visualizing insights derived from
the provided JSON data, enabling users to gain valuable insights and make informed
decisions based on the data analysis.
